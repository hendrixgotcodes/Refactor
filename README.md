A light weight CLI tool designed to make developers more robust in refactoring large codebase.

- Change extensions of multiple files with just one command
- Rename multiple files much more faster than the traditional way
- Rename multiple directories

*Refactor is in it's early stages. Your contributions and suggestions are more than welcome ðŸ˜Ž*

## Installation
